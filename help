 #Build the Docker image
 docker build -t using-fastapi .

 # Start the Docker container
docker run -d --name using-fastapi-c -p 80:80 using-fastapi
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/app:/app using-fastapi /start-reload.sh

docker exec -u root -it using-fastapi_using-fast-api_1  bash




Run the development server (like uvicorn main:app --reload).



Notes:
** All the data validation is performed under the hood by Pydantic
**
With FastAPI, by using short, intuitive and standard Python type declarations, you get:

Editor support: error checks, autocompletion, etc.
Data "parsing"
Data validation
API annotation and automatic documentation
And you only have to declare them once.

That's probably the main visible advantage of FastAPI compared to alternative frameworks
